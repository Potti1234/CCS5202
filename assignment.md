Dataset Selection:

Choose a dataset from a trusted source (e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or a similar platform) that contains at least 10 million rows or more.

Provide a brief description of the dataset, including its origin, structure, and key attributes.

Setup & Environment:

Install PySpark on your local machine or use Google Colab.

Demonstrate how to set up the PySpark environment, including necessary configurations for distributed computing.

Provide code snippets for setting up the environment, initializing a Spark session, and loading the dataset into PySpark.

Data Preprocessing:

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical data, data normalization).

Use PySpark’s DataFrame API for processing and transformation of large datasets.

Provide a summary of the transformations made to the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform descriptive statistics on the dataset using PySpark, including:

Distribution of key variables

Correlation analysis

Trends and patterns using PySpark’s visualization capabilities or exporting the data for visualization tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

Big Data Algorithms:

Implement at least two machine learning algorithms using PySpark’s MLlib library, such as:

Decision Trees

Logistic Regression

K-Means Clustering

Collaborative Filtering (ALS)

Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall for classification; RMSE, MAE for regression).

Performance Optimization:

Analyze and optimize the performance of your PySpark job.

Implement caching, partitioning, or parallelism techniques to improve execution time and memory management.

Compare performance before and after optimization.

Visualization and Insights:

Visualize the outcomes of your analysis.

Summarize key insights and trends from the data.

Highlight how the distributed nature of PySpark enhanced your analysis process.
